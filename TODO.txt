TCP protocol:


- joining game
    - if game has started:
        - while game not finished:
            - server -> client: <spectator_next_turn>
            - client -> server: <spectator_next_turn_acknowledgment>
            - if no acknowledgment received resend
            - if no game_state received, close connection

    - if game has not started:
        - server -> client: <join_game>
        - client -> server: <join_game_acknowledgment>
        - if no acknowledgment received resend, then disconnect

- game loop
    while game not finished:
        - server -> client: <next_turn>
        - client -> server: <next_turn_acknowledgment> or <play_card>
        - if no acknowledgment received resend, then disconnect
    server -> client <game_result>

robimy jednego hosta który jest jednocześnie serwerem i klientem, czy robimy osobno serwer i klienta?
